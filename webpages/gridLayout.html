                <h3>Ecuador</h3>
                <p>Ecuador is a country straddling the equator on South America’s west coast. Its diverse landscape 
                    encompasses Amazon jungle, Andean highlands and the wildlife-rich Galápagos Islands. In the Andean 
                    foothills at an elevation of 2,850m, Quito, the capital, is known for its largely intact Spanish 
                    colonial center, with decorated 16th- and 17th-century palaces and religious sites, like the ornate 
                    Compañía de Jesús Church.</p>

                <h3>Peru</h3>
                <p>Peru is a country in South America that's home to a section of Amazon rainforest and Machu Picchu, 
                    an ancient Incan city high in the Andes mountains. The region around Machu Picchu, including the 
                    Sacred Valley, Inca Trail and colonial city of Cusco, is rich in archaeological sites. On Peru’s 
                    arid Pacific coast is Lima, the capital, with a preserved colonial center and important collections 
                    of pre-Columbian art.</p>

                <h3>Bolivia</h3>
                <p> Bolivia is a country in central South America, with a varied terrain spanning Andes Mountains, 
                    the Atacama Desert and Amazon Basin rainforest. At more than 3,500m, its administrative capital, 
                    La Paz, sits on the Andes’ Altiplano plateau with snow-capped Mt. Illimani in the background. 
                    Nearby is glass-smooth Lake Titicaca, the continent’s largest lake, straddling the border with Peru.</p>

                <h3>Biking down the most dangerous road</h3>
                <p> The Yungas Road is a cycle route about 60 km long that links the city of La Paz and the Yungas region 
                    of Bolivia. It draws about 25,000 tourists per year and is a major La Paz tourist attraction. 
                    Many tour operators cater to downhill mountain biking. At least 18 cyclists have died on the road 
                    since 1998.</p>

                <h3>1 of 7 wonders of the world</h3>
                <p> Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River 
                    valley. Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone 
                    walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical
                     alignments and panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.</p>
